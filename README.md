ChatOps Bot for our Gitter Chat Channel
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datopian/ourbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datopian/ourbot)

Our Hubot-based bot to automate lots of stuff including:

- logging of specific messages from our (gitter) chat channel. See #1

## How to use it

In your chat channle tag at start, middle or end of a message:

```
+todo ...
...  +todo ...

... +todo
```

This will get logged to the doc as:

```
yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM {message} [from:@{username}]

```

## Installation

You'll need to install coffee-script and hubot to run the app and tests. To install follow here:

```
npm install -g hubot coffee-script
```

Install the app:
```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/atomatichq/ourbot.git
cd ourbot
npm install
```
Run the tests
```
npm test
```

### Configuration

For running this one you need to do few really quick steps.

#### Configure the bot

```javascript=
// some of this should be auto loaded from environment variables (so we can config on heroku)

// config.json
{
  github_auth:
  gdocs_auth:
  docs: {
    "gist1": {
      "type": "gist"
    }
    "gdocs1": {
      "type": "gdocs"
    }
  }
  monitor: {
    "+todo": {
      "action"": "log",
      "dest": "gist1"
    },
    "+standup": ...
  }
}
```

This will then match +todo and log to gist1 doc.
