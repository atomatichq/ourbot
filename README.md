ChatOps Bot for our Gitter Chat Channel
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datopian/ourbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datopian/ourbot)

Our Hubot-based bot to automate lots of stuff including:

- logging of specific messages from our (gitter) chat channel. See #1

## How to use it

In your chat channle tag at start, middle or end of a message:

```
+todo ...
...  +todo ...

... +todo
```

This will get logged to the doc as:

```
yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM {message} [from:@{username}]

```

## Installation

You'll need to install coffee-script and hubot to run the app and tests. To install follow here:

```
npm install -g hubot coffee-script
```

Install the app:
```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/atomatichq/ourbot.git
cd ourbot
npm install
```
Run the tests
```
npm test
```

### Configuration

For running this one you need to do few really quick steps.

#### Configure the bot

```javascript=
// some of this should be auto loaded from environment variables (so we can config on heroku)

// config.json
{
    "docs": {
        "gdoc1": {
            "fun": "sendMessage",
            "dest": "gdocid1"
        },
        "gist1": {
            "fun": "sendGist",
            "dest": "gistid"
        },
        "gdoc2": {
            "fun": "sendMessage",
            "dest": "gdocid2"
        }
    },
    "monitor": {
        "+todo": {
            "action": "log",
            "dest": ["gdoc1", "gist1"]
        },
        "+standup": {
            "action": "log",
            "dest": ["gdoc1"]
        },
        "+example": {
            "action": "log",
            "dest": ["gdoc2"]
        }
    }
}
```

With the configurations above bot will log `+todo`'s in one of Google docs and Gist,
`+standup`'s only in Google doc and `+example` in another Google doc

Set the environment variables form `.env` for Heroku

```
$ heroku config:set VARIABLE_NAME=VaRIabLE

To keep bot alive on Heroku you need to set following environment variables:
* `HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL` - required, the complete URL to keepalive, including a trailing slash.

* `HUBOT_HEROKU_SLEEP_TIME` - optional, the time of day (HH:MM) when hubot should go to sleep. Default: 22:00 (10 pm)
* `HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` - the interval in which to keepalive, in minutes. Default: 5

You *must* set `HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL` and it *must* include a trailing slash â€“ otherwise the script won't run.
You can find out the value for this by running `heroku apps:info`. Copy the `Web URL` and run:

```
heroku config:set HUBOT_HEROKU_KEEPALIVE_URL=PASTE_WEB_URL_HERE
```
